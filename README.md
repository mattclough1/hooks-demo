# Hooks Demo

Hi! I threw together some demos of React Hooks in the form of a Gatsby site. It's not so useful as a site itself, but was just a quick way to get a React project going with some filesystem navigation ðŸ’…

It could definitely be made into more of an interactive learning resource. If you want to contribute, go for it! If you've never forked / made a PR into another repo, here's a little how-to on that: [GitHub Standard Fork & Pull Request Workflow Â· GitHub](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

If you want to read the official intro to Hooks before getting into this, let me find the link...

And here it is! [Introducing Hooks â€“ React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)

# Getting this thing running

Basically just cd into the repo and run

```
yarn install
yarn develop
```

and then you should be able to check out your work at `localhost:8000`
